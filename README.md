### ğŸ‘‹ Hola!
## Mandala Art
ğŸŒ± This is mostly inspired by flowers and a looooot of pictures on google.
ğŸŒ± This also took me a while to make because I wasn't satisfied with it and did try a couple of different ways and designs.
ğŸŒ± I wanted to try it with gradient colors but then I also wanted to stick to how it is traditionally, black and white.
